## Thought Process / To-Do

# Ore Gen
1a Make sure that the mining dimension has standard ore gen for those who want to opt out. 
1b. Issue with the mining world is that now players are going to quarry the OW......perhaps making a seperate dim entirely for opt-outers and those who want quarry worlds should be made.
2a Take E21's ore-gen for motherlode ore
2b. Modify said ore-gen to make sure that it fits with BWM strata
2c. Figure out when we should actually let people mine certain ores and implement. Something along the lines of -> lead only spawns below diamond strata zone. 

# World gen
1a. Terrian needs some help. My settings for Climate Control seem to be making a lot of islands and I want a large landmass thats several thousands blocks across with banded climates. 
2a. McJtys cities always look really odd. If someone could make them look better I might add them in.
3a. Streams also looks really odd to me. They always seem to get in the way.
4a. Recurrent Complex style mods would need a lot of tweaking 

# Progression Tweaks 
1a. Force players to use a "low tech" mod in the early game. Something like BWM or Windmills for power, etc.
2a. Attempt to gate mods behind large resource requirements instead of gating behind other mods. This would allow for more resource autoamtion and crafting requirements over rushing through certain mods. 
3a. Logistics: Force players to use low tech logistics (belts) before getting to things like pipes, and finally at the end game getting AE2. While i am not going to "gate" the pipes behind other mods I might want to require something like dense plates to make pipes which needs a machine that would be extremely expensive to make.  
4a. botania and AS have almost no changes as of now. that needs fixing.
5a. figure out how to balance void miners and bees. this might be the hardest thing to do as everyone will just rush this.
6a. Loot tables need to be tweaked. 

# Mod additions
1a. That convyor belt mod: see if its better than IE and how versatile and stable the mod is. 
2a. other early game mods?
3a. mods that are based around long range walking/travel
4a. there are several mods that i need to test more to see how they would fit. nuclear craft, atomic science, magneticraft, factory tech

# Mod deletions
1a. Gadgetry - While a very fun mod its loss of its dev may force me to take it out. A lot of mods can do what it does already. 

# Fixes
1a. FTB guides broke. dunno why.
2a. Better background for main title screen.
