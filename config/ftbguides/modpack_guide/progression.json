	"The main idea behind this pack is a kitchen sink pack with heavy automation. Two key ideas to help that are to gate higher level machines while avoiding gating mods behind other mods, and to force long logistic routes via a lack of item teleportation coupled with biome dependant ores. There are several tiers which are based on what kind of miner you can craft. Players still have options to opt-out through  means like bee's.",
	"",
	"Tier 0: Manual mining and upgrades for it. Tinkers Construct, Silent Gems, Actually Additions, Botania, and Immersive Engineering all have tools which can mine large areas (typically 3x3x1). A smeltry is a good option for beginning ore processing.",
	"",
	"Note: If you want to try silent gems i9nstead of tinkers construct I would advise finding a desert. All of the overworld gem types generate there.",
	"",
	"Tier 1: Your first bits of automation. For this you can setup Steve's Carts, IC2 (cart miner), Advanced Rocketry (Asteroid Mining) and Actually Additions (Vertical Digger). Your base should now have some power along with more automated ore processing. Steel production needs to be ramped way up. Walking gets old and you'll want to start working towards long range logisitcs for your mines. Signals/Immersive Railroading (trains), Advanced Rocketry (rockets), and Opencomputers/Pneumaticraft (drones) are all great options.",
	"",
	"Note: While trains require far less up front infrastructure, rockets are much easier to scale or add more routes. They require far more infrastructure, but also have the added benefit of space travel and eventual off world mining capabilitis.",
	"",
	"Tier 2: This is where the big boys start to come out. Rftools (Builder Quarry) is your best option. Before you could get away without any real logistics but now you need a way massive amounts of products coming from your mines.",
	"",
	"Note: Many quarry style diggers require a lot of steel. Steel will only be made using iron and coal coke. You may want to automate both iron and coal veins in order to get the amount of steel required.",
	"",
	"Tier 3: Your miners are among the very best. Mekanism(digital miner), Rftools(Builder Quarry + Filter), and the EXU2 Quarry can finally be built to great effect. If you wish get rid of your logistics network you can begin working towards AE2 quantum singularities to teleport items as needed.",
	"",
	"Tier 4: Resrouces are no longer an issue for you. You have overcome the biome dependancy for ores by utilizing AAdvaned Rocketry (Laser Drill), Botania(thingy), Immersive Engineering (Excavator), Bee's , or Actually Additions (Mining Lens). You can now teleport wherever you want with the Matter tx/rx from Rftools and even construct your own dimensions.",
